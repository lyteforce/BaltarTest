# BaltarTest

Using a few tutorials as a foundation, with some very (and I mean VERY) rudimentary knowledge of Python, the aptly named BaltarTest Discord bot is just a playground I'll look to evolve as my adventures ensue. This bad little bot is also my hands-on entry into the world of Git (or is it Github?), so don't be too upset if I break things and/or don't respond right away. It's not at all personal - just me trying to figure things out.
